Rengo rehu ni kuelekeza akurima wapate mapato madzo kombola kwa ukurima,We aim to guide and help farmers earn a decent living from farming.
Faith agro inarahisisha sayansi ili akurima watsini waweze kuelewa,Faith Agro simplifies farming terminologies and science into a language that a peasant farmer can understand.
Hunahakikisha akurima kawang'anga'na wachenda sokoni,We ensure farmers do not struggle when going to the market.
kamnautu enzangu,Hello friends
hunanyala matsere wakati wa msimu wa mvula bomu ,We grow maize or corn for the long rain maize season.
ino ihendwa hamwenga ili huweze kufananisha,This was done alongside us so that we can compare.
huhenda vivi ili huweze kufananisha matokeo gehu na genu ili hupate Matumaini,We did this so that we can compare our results with yours to give all of us hope.
hunamanya kala asilimia 70 mpata tototo,We know for sure that about 70% of you got it right.
ila asilimia 30 ya sisi hukosera,"However, approximately 30% of us got it wrong."
jukumu rehu ni kuwafundisha huhenda vitu kwa nzira inayofaa,"As is the norm, ours is to share with you how to do it the right way."
huwaonyesa jinsi atu anjine afaulu na arau ambao kawafaulire,We aim to show you how others failed and share with you how others succeeded.
Kufanikiwa kwa ukurima ni kudzo hususani katika nyaladzi wamatsere,"Success in farming is very sweet, especially if it is success in maize farming."
kuhumira gago hundakala hudzawasaidia usawa wakati mungine,"With that, we will have helped you get it right next time."
"kwa kawaida ku faulu katika ukurima wa kunyala matsere ,henda sawa wakati wa.kwanza","As we always say, to succeed in maize farming, do it right the first time."
sasa hinde hufikirie go ga nyuma cho kirichohendeka katika Mradi wa unyali wa matsere,"Now, let us have a quick recap of the events that happened during this maize farming project."
kumbukeni kala inamanufaa kwa kila akurima anaohenda ukurima wa.matsere,"Remember, this is in the best interest of all farmers doing maize farming as a business."
"Zizi ndo hatua hu humira ,huanza na kurima kwanza",These are the steps we followed: we started with fast plowing.
wakati wa kurima hunarima chombo chochosi kinachopatikana,"When plowing, we use whatever plowing implement is available to you."
inaeza kala tingatinga au jembe ra ubao ra ukungu,It could be a tractor-pulled disc or moldboard plow.
inaeza humira  vidzembe vya mukono,It could be small handheld tillers.
angine huhumira ng'ombe kurima,Others will use ox plows.
angine huhumira majembe kunyala,Some may dig the farm by using jambes or hoes.
baada ya gago richa nyasi sikauke na kola wakati wa dzua ,"After that, allow weeds to dry and decompose using a short dry period that normally follows."
alafu richa ngano imere kawaida,Then allow the wheat to grow normally.
Msimu mtite hudza baada ya wiki mwenga au mbiri inayosababisha nyasi kumera kaheri,"A very short rain season appears, of about one week or two weeks, which allows weeds to grow."
baada ya gago mwaga dawa ya kulaga nyasi zimerazo,"After that, apply herbicides that kill coochi grass and other growing weeds."
alafu rima mara ya hiri,Then do the second plowing.
kurima kwa hiri huwezesha mbolea.iombolayo kwa nyasi za kola kuinjira kwenye mtsanga ,Second plowing incorporates dry and decomposing plants into the soil.
Ukisharimarigiza ku rima tengeza mitaru kwenye munda,"After second plowing, harrow the farm."
,Then plant your seed immediately.
msisahau kuhumira mbeyu mbeyu ya msimu mure,Don't forget to use certified hybrid long season maize seed.
namala mulole urichaji wa nafasi unaohumuka kwa ukurima wa hali ya dzulu,I want to ask you to observe the standard spacing allowed for professional maize farming.
usinyale kiholelaholela,Don't just plant anyhow.
Unyali mudzo ni kuricha nafasi mbizo ya kiufundi ,"Ideal spacing is relative, and we can have several spacings that are acceptable professionally."
hinde hugombe kuhusu aina mbiri zinazohumika,Let us discuss the two common ones.
ya kwanza ni kuhumira sentimita 75 ama futi 2.5kwa mtaro mwenga Na sentimita 25 ama futi 0.8 kwa kila mumea ukihumira mbeyu mwenga kila wina ,"The first is 75 cm or 2.5 ft from row to row and 25 cm or 0.8 ft from plant to plant within the row, one seed per hole or planting station."
mbinu ya hili ya urichaji wa nafasi ni sentimita 75 ama futi 2.5 kwa mtaro na sentimita 50 ama futi 1.6 kila wina unyale mbeyu mbiri ,"The second spacing type is 75 cm or 2.5 ft from row to row and 50 cm or 1.6 ft from one planting station to another, with two seeds per planting station or hole."
idadi ya mimea kila mtaro wa mbeyu mwenga ni 253,Plant population per row for one seed per hole is 253.
idadi ya mimea kila mtaro wa mbeyu mbiri kila wina ni 254,Plant population per row for two seeds per hole is 254.
idadi ya mimea kila eka irio na mbeyu mwenga kila wina ni 21000,"The plant population per acre for one seed per hole is 21,000."
Io ni mbeyu mwenga kila wina,That is one seed per hole.
idadi ya mimea kwa eka ukihumira mbeyu mbiri kila wina ni 21590,"The plant population per acre when you are using a spacing of two seeds per hole is 21,590."
ii inamaanisha idadi ya mimea hekta ukihumira mbeyu mwenga kila wina ni 53099,"What this means is that the plant population per hectare for one seed per hole is 53,099."
idadi ya mimea kwa hekta ukihumira mbeyu mbiri kila wina ni 53039,"The plant population per hectare if you are using two seeds per hole is 53,039."
Mbolea ya kunyalira ni ikale na Fosfati ya hali ya dhulu,Planting fertilizer should be one that contains high phosphate.
Kwa kesi yehu hunahumira asimilia ya 46 ya fosifati,"In our case, we normally use 46% P."
"unaeza humira ya 23,23,0 lakini  Wingi undakala dzulu kwa sababu ya uchache wa ","You can also use a blend of 23-23-0, but the quantity will be higher because of the low percentage of phosphate."
kwa sisi hunahumira gramu 5kwa mumea kwa jumla ni kilo 106 kwa eka mwenga,"For us, we applied 5 grams per plant, and the total was 106 kg per acre."
baada ya io unahenzekana kumwaga dawa ya kulaga nyasi ,"After that, you will be required to spray preemergent or early postemergent herbicides."
inafaa kuhendwa kabla ya steji ya tsano ya makodza mtsanga ukikala bado unamadzi,"This should be done before the five-leaf stage, as long as the soil has moisture."
Kabla ya steji ya tsano ya makodza kuchomoka unaeza nyunyuzia dawa siku ya kunyaka ama kabla ya mimea kuchomoza ,"Before the five-leaf stage means you can spray from the day of planting, before germination, or after germination, until the five-leaf stage."
ukinyunyiza dawa kala mutsanga kauna madzi dawa kaindahenda kazi ,"If these herbicides are sprayed when the soil is not moist, they will not work."
kisha hunaika mbolea ya dzulu baada ya wiki sita ,Then we applied top dressing fertilizer at 6 weeks.
sino hunahumira mbolea ya urea irio na asilimia 46 ya  Nitrojeni,"In our case, we used urea, which contains 46% nitrogen."
yosi ni gramu 5 kwa mumea idadi yosi kwa eka ni kilo 107.5 au magunia 2.1 ya kilo 50,"Red was 5 grams per plant, and the total per acre was 107.5 kg, or 2.1 bags of 50 kg."
Hwe uyira baada ya wiki mbiri kaheri na idadi ioio ya mbeyu ya dhulu,We repeated this 2 weeks later with the same amount of top dressing fertilizer.
ukihumira mbeyu mbiri kila wina undahumira gramu 10 kila wina,"Note, however, that if you use two seeds per hole, the fertilizer per planting station or hole is 10 grams."
haleni muda wenu muingire kwa tovuti yehu kala umujeni,Take time to subscribe to our channel if you are new or if you have not done so already.
takala bado haudzavuna hunatarajia mavuno ga kilo 6350.5 kwa eka,"Since we have not harvested yet, our anticipated yield is 6,350.5 kg per acre."
indahupa mavuno ga maginia 71kwa kilo 90 ga matsere kwa eka,This gives a yield of 71 bags of 90 kg dry maize per acre.
mnavoona ukurima wa matsere ni biashara mbidzo,"As you can all see, maize farming is an enjoyable venture if you do it right."
kwa bei ya 3500 pesa ya kenya au 27.34 pesa ya marekani kwa kila gunia ra kilo 90 undapata faida ya 250000.891 pesa ya kenya,"At the current price of 3,500 Kenya Shillings or 27.34 USD per bag of 90 kg dry maize, the gross return per acre will be 250,000.891 Kenya Shillings."
ii ni pesa 1900.60 pesa ya marekani,"This is equivalent to 1,900.60 USD."
gharama yosi ikihunguzwa undapata 198000.891 pesa ya kenya,"Net profit after all expenses have been deducted will be 198,000.891 Kenya Shillings per acre."
Ii ni sawa na  faida ya 1553 pesa ya marekani,"This is equivalent to 1,553 USD net profit per acre."
ii indaweza pata ndani ya miezi 5 ya kunyala,This you can achieve in 5 months of farming.
ukihumira eka 10 undahumira shilingi 520000 sawa na 4062 pesa ya marekani,"Maize, if you do just 10 acres, you can spend 520,000 Kenya Shillings, equivalent to 4,062 USD."
faida yosi ni shilingi 1988991.6 kwa eka 10,"Net profit will be 1,988,991.6 Kenya Shillings from 10 acres."
ahumirao pesa za marekani ni sawa na pesa  15538 kwa eka kumi ndani ya miezi 5 ,"For those using USD, this is equivalent to 15,538 USD net profit from 10 acres of land in five months."
mnavoona  ukurima wa matsere unafaida mbidzo,"As you can see, farming maize is a profitable venture, but only if you know how to do it right."
ndo mana hunahala muda wehu kugomba kila mara ili akurima wanufaike,That is why we take time to talk about the subject again and again until all the farmers get it right.
swali kwa akurima osi .humirani ubomu wa shamba unaoweza kuukimu ,"A question to all farmers is, always farm the size of land you can be able to manage."
asanteni na mnakaribishwa,Thank you and welcome.
Huambire kuhusu ukurima wa ma tunda ga karakara,"So tell us the other stories to do with passion fruit farming today, bro."
biashara ya karakara ukihivyo,How is passion taking passion fruit businesses?
go matunda ganaguzwa kwa 100 au 120,The fruits right now are fetching between 100 to 120.
nivivyo kwasababu inaeleweka ,"Yes, because it has some scarcity."
kala biashara i tsini undaguza kwa bei hio?,"Okay, and when it is at worst, how much does a kg cost at once?"
kuna bei mbiri  ni kuanzira 80 au 100,There are two prices: the aggressive farmer will get between 80 and 100.
kala umukaha kuhenda kazi ,"If you are lazy enough not to look for the market,"
undapata 80 kwenda tsini,you can get anything below 80 shillings downwards.
kakueza kukala na unji wa kiki chakurya,There can never be a surplus of this food.
Shida bomu ni kutegemea aguzi sana,The only thing is over-reliance on brokers.
aguzi ndo huvunza morali akurima,"Yes, brokers are the main people who will discourage farmers."
kwavivyo ukitafuta soko mwenye,"So if you can go a step further and look for the market,"
ukiguza mwenye sokoni undapata pesa mbidzo,"approach the market directly, you're going to get your cash, and good cash."
Undamanya kala ukiguza kwa kilo undapata faida mbizo,You will realize that anything you sell per kilo puts you at an advantage compared to selling pieces.
kwa io undakala na uhakika,"So that one, it is something that is well quantifiable."
kuna soko ra konze ama ni soko ra mumu kwa mumu,"Do we have an export market, or are we just dealing with the local market?"
hunahumira soko hiro,Which market are we dealing with?
kwa vivyo matunda ga karakara ni madzo kuguza,"So, passion fruit is a lucky fruit you suppose to market."
kila soko rina mahitaji ga kwake,Every market has its own demand.
soko ra mumu mumu humala matunda garigo tamu,"Yes, for the local market, they require a fruit that is very sweet."
na kisha wanamala garigo na ubomu wa usawa,"At the same time, they require a medium-sized fruit."
Soko ra konze humala ubora kawamala utamu ,"For the exports, they require high quality; don't look at the sweetness as much."
ukikala na karakara ga ubora mudzo,"Once you have good quality passion fruit,"
soko ra konze karimala mwonekano mudzo,the export market does not focus on the appearance.
kawalola mwokekano wanamala kitu kiricho tamu,They do not mind the looks as much; they just want something that is sweet.
ila undapata ateja wanalola mwonekano,"However, you will find that some customers focus on the appearance."
tunda risirokala na rangi mbizo  kavariheza kwasababu wanaamini kala si tamu,"If the fruit is very purple and smooth, they may dislike it because they assume it is not sweet."
