Ila masoko ga konze humala utamu urio ndani si mwonekano,"But for the export market, they care more about the taste inside than the outside appearance."
unaeza himiza atu kala ukurima wa karakara ni chaguo ridzo,You can advise anyone starting out that passion fruit farming is a good choice.
kawanda dziutha,They will never regret it.
Unaeza anza na matunda ga karakara kwa sababu ni ukirima mudzo,"You can start with passion fruits, and they are great for farming."
kuna vitu vihahu muhimu vya kulolera,There are three key things to consider.
cha kwanza ni madzi,The first one is the availability of water.
mapashoni gana uhitaji wa madzi ga kunyunyizira mwaka mzima mfululizo ,Passion fruits require water for irrigation throughout the year.
"bila madzi ,mimera yakwako indapata thabu nyinji.","Without water, your crops will face many problems."
"kwavizho, madzi ndo kitu cha kwanza muhimu","So, water is the first important factor."
cha hiri ni jinsi uipazho chakurya,The second one is your feeding program.
Unahitaji mbinu mbidzo yakuipa chakurya.,You need a good feeding system.
Unafaha kuhumira mbolea za tembe na za madzi.,You should use both granular fertilizers and liquid fertilizers.
Unaeza humira mbolea  Kikaboni inayosaidia karakara kunawiri tototo,"You can also use manure, especially organic manure, which helps passion fruits grow better."
kitu kiricho na umuhimu ni ubora wa miche,The third key factor is the quality of the seedlings.
ubora wa miche undareha mavuno madzo,The quality of the seedlings will determine the quality of the harvest.
ni here biashara zingine msingi mudzo  ni lazima ,"Just like in other businesses, the foundation matters."
kwa soko ni mambo gaga gaga tu,"As for the market, I thought it was part of these factors."
soko si shida,"No, the market is not a problem."
unaeza anza kurima na kutafuta soko badae,You can start farming and find the market along the way.
ta ukenda soko umdapata karakara zikiguzwa,"Even if you go to a local market, you will see passion fruits being sold."
mfano sokoni matunda mahahu ganaguzwa kwa shilingi 50,"For example, on the streets, they sell three fruits for 50 shillings."
io ni here kilo 150 au kilo 200,That would be around 150 to 200 shillings per kilogram.
na anatengeza faida,And they are making a profit.
"usikale na shaka kuhusu soko ,soko rinapatikana","So, there is no worry about the market; it is guaranteed."
akurima anaeza nyala karakara bila wasiwasi wa soko,Farmers can grow passion fruits without fear because the market is available.
sasa hinde hunene huhusu pande ya hiri ya kutayarisha mbeyu,"Now, let's talk about the next part: seed preparation."
umkurima wa kutengeza mbeyu na wa kunyala,You are a seed propagator and also a farmer.
Unahenda kazi na akurima elfu mwenga wanaopata mbeyu kombola kwako,"You work with over a thousand farmers, who get their seedlings from you."
go mashamba hukirira hutambua kitu,"Among the many farms you've visited, you noticed something."
ni maswali higo akurima huuza kuhusu mbeyu,What is the common issue or question that farmers have when it comes to seedlings?
Ni siri hio ya kufanikiwa kwa akurima wa kunyala karakara,What is the secret to success with passion fruit farming?
mbeyu zenu zina manufaa higo ta atu angule kwenu,"Why are your seedlings special, and why should people come to you for seedlings?"
Matunda ga karakara si rahisi kunyala lakini pia ni rahisi ukihenda vitu njira mbidzo,Passion fruit is a tricky plant to grow but also very easy if you do things the right way.
mfano unaezapata muhi wa karakara umera kwa mbeyu zirizo bwagwa na ndenge,"For example, you might see a passion fruit plant growing naturally, perhaps because birds dropped seeds there."
uo muhi unaeza kula na komboza matunda ga hali ya dzulu,"That plant might thrive, producing high-quality fruits."
ukihumira mbeyu zizo undapata kaindakupa mazao madzo,"But if you try to plant passion fruits on your farm, even using the same seeds, the results may not be as good."
sababu hukala mumea wa karakara huvamiwa rahisi na makongo,"This happens because passion fruit is affected by diseases, and these diseases spread easily."
makongo gaga hurehwa na vidudu virivyo mundani,The diseases are carried by insects or other things around the farm.
ukinyala karakara hakeye vidudu vindavamia na indakala vigumu kuviomboza,"When you grow only passion fruits, the pests will focus on your crops, making it harder to control the problem."
ni muhimu kuhumira mbinu inayofaa,That’s why it’s important to start the right way and take good care of the plants.
kafuhumira mboyu zozosi kunyala karakara,We don't just use any seeds to grow passion fruits.
hunahumira aina mbiri za mbeyu Mizizi na vitagai ,There are two types of seeds we work with: the rootstock and the scion.
"kwa mizizi humahumira mbeyu ya ""bitter yello""","For the rootstock, we use a type of passion fruit called ""bitter yellow."""
matunda gaga hukala tsatsu ta gakiiva,"This yellow fruit is very bitter, even when ripe."
ta ukiongeza sukati bado hukala tsatsu,"Even if you add sugar, it remains bitter."
Ii aina ni mbizo kwasababu hukala na mizizi ya nguvu,This type is the best for rootstock because it has strong roots.
mizizi husambaa tototo na hueza kumera kutu kuriko na ukame,Its roots spread widely and are well-suited for dry areas.
ii mizizi hufyonza virutubishi tototo kuchangia muhi kumera tototo,"These roots take in nutrients efficiently, helping the plant grow well."
"Kwa vitagai hunahumira ""purple passion"" kwa sababu inahenzekana sana","For the scion, we use the purple passion fruit variety because it is in high demand."
hunatsanganya mbeyu ya purple na yellow ,We graft the purple variety onto the bitter yellow rootstock.
utsanganyi uu hutengeza muhi urio na mazao madzo,This combination ensures a healthy and productive plant.
Baada ya  kupandikiza unanyala miche kwa kuricha nafasi ,"After grafting, we move on to planting the seedlings with proper spacing."
miche ya karakara hunyalwa kwa kuricha nafasi ya mita Mwenga kwa kila muhi ,Passion fruit plants are spaced 3 meters apart from plant to plant.
kwa kila mtaro richa nafasi ya mita mbiri,"From row to row, the spacing is 2 meters."
zizi nafasi ni muhimu kwa sababu muhi wa karakara husambaa hatu ha bomu unahoku,This spacing is important because passion fruit plants spread out widely as they grow.
ila mita 1.5 na zaidi idadi ya matunda ganagoombola hupungua,"However, from 1.5 meters going further, you realize that the quality of fruits reduces."
 Ni jambo tite ila kaindamera tototo kwa kala zibanana sana,"It will be a very small issue, but they won’t grow well because you have overloaded them."
undakala unaenderera huijiza virutubishi ambyo kaindakala mbinu mbizo,"You have to keep replenishing the nutrients, which is not very sufficient."
ndo mana hunawasihi muhumire nafasi mbidzo,That’s why we encourage proper spacing.
kwa mlingoti mwenga unafaa kukimu mimea miri,"For a single post, two plants should be supported."
kwa milingoti miri inafaa kukimu mimea miri kila upande,"For two posts, they should support at least two plants on each side."
ninavyoona kwa nafasi ii undapata ni vivyo kila hatu,"Like I am seeing from this place, you can observe the same everywhere."
inamaanisha kala kombola mlingoti mwenga hadi mungine ni mita sita,That means from one post to the other is six meters.
Sasa hinde kwa waya,Now let’s go to the wire.
kwa waya hunahumira waya sisizo na kutu,"For the wires, we use galvanized wire."
hunahumira waya zizi kwasababu kazi pata kutu,We use galvanized wire because it prevents rust.
kutu husababisha kukala kwa makongo,Rust usually causes or promotes the development of diseases.
Makongo gaga ndo sababu hunakosa kuzihumira,These diseases are one of the issues we try to avoid.
ganaeza ku tibiwa lakini ni viguma wakati gakianza,"They can be managed, but it’s difficult to handle them once they start."
baada ya kutengeza nafasi unaeza anza kunyala,"After you have done the spacing, you plant your plants."
kawaida hunahumira mbolea ya kawaida kwenye ndoo,"Usually, we use composed manure in buckets."
unaeza onjeza mbolea ya fosiforasi,You can also add phosphorus fertilizer.
"na pia ya kuzuia unaeza himira ""trichoderma""","As a preventive measure, you can add Trichoderma."
indawezesha kuzuia upungufu wa Sodiamu kwenye mtsanga,It will help you prevent Sodium Wilt.
ina baha kwa sababu si rahisi kumarigiza ri tatizo,At least it will manage it because you cannot completely get rid of it.
"kitu kingine ni lazima uonjeze ""nematicide""",Another thing you must add is a nematicide.
Nematicide huhumika kulaga nematodes,You use the nematicide to kill nematodes.
inawezesha mimea kutovamiwa na nematodes,This ensures your plant is free of nematodes.
nematodes huvamia mimea ya karakara,Nematodes usually attack the passion fruit plants.
hufunga uwezo wa mimea kunyonya virutubishi,They block the uptake of nutrients in the plants.
ni here huzia shingo ya mumea kusababisha chakurya kisikihe,"It’s like they hold the plant’s neck, stopping food from passing through."
Ii ndo huhendeka mimea ikivamiwa na nematotodes,This is what happens when nematodes attack your plant.
kwa mimea ya karakara ni muhimu kunyala kwa mbinu ifaayo,"For passion fruit plants, it is important to plant them correctly."
tuiriza mkondo uu ili kuwezesha mimea imere tototo,Follow these steps to ensure good growth and avoid issues.
inaziya yo singo,It blocks the neck.
ni here kuziya shingo ta kakurya kisichire,"It's like holding the neck, so food is not going through."
ni jezi mumea kauweza kukiza chakurya,"Yes, the plant cannot take up food."
ni jeri kaiweza kukiza virutubishi,"Yes, they can’t absorb nutrients."
zizi ndo vionjezi  vihahu ndo unafaa kuhumira,"Now, those are the three additives I would encourage you to use."
hinde huuye nyuma,Let me take you back.
uhadza mbolea,You mentioned manure.
kunaika mbolea kbla ya kunyala,We had manure before planting.
kiasi chani cha mbolea na mbolea hizo ni mbodzo,"What quantities of manure are best, and which manure is the best?"
hata binadamu ana mbolea mbidzo,"You have good manure, even for human beings."
io ni mbinu hatari,That one is a very dangerous approach.
atu adhapingana na ue,People will argue with you.
mbolea mbidzo ni mtsanganyiko,Good manure means it is mixed.
si kombola kwa ngombe hakeye,It’s not just from cows alone.
si kombola kwa gonzi  hakeye,It’s not just from sheep alone.
ni mtsanganyiko wa mbolea ya ngombe,It’s a mixture of cattle manure.
