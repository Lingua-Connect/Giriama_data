Ii mbinu ni rahisi,This process is simple.
"Atu ahahu ndo anamalikana kunya eka mwenga,mwenga wa mbolea ,mmwenga wa kunyala na mwenga wa kufukira mbeyu na mtsanga","You only need three people to plant an acre—one for the fertilizer, one for scouting, and one for covering the seeds with soil."
dze mnafikiria kala zi nafasi ni bomu ?,Don’t you think this spacing is too big?
Hata zi nafasii ta si bomu ,"No, the spacing is not too big."
mukumbuke kala i aina ya matsere ni gara matite,"Remember, this maize variety is short."
"ukihesabu namba ya makodza ,ni machache na kuika kwake kunamala hatu hatite","When you count the number of leaves, they are fewer, and their placement is slightly shorter."
sababu ya kuricha nafasi ya kutosha ni ili makodza gapate nafasi ya kutosha ya kupata mwanga wa dzua,The reason we leave enough space is to ensure the leaves can capture enough sunlight.
ukilola muundowa makodza hukala ganamera kwa mwelekeo mmwenga ili gapate mwanga wadzua wakutosha,"When you observe the pattern of the leaves, they grow in a single direction to maximize sunlight capture."
"Mwanga wa dzua huombola pande mwenga na kutua pande injine ,ii mimea huzoera muundo uoo","The sun rays move in one direction, rising here and setting on the other side, and the plant adapts to this pattern."
"Baada ya matsere kuomboza viguguta ,makodza hugaluza Mwelekeo ili kupata mwaga wa dzua tototo","After the maize has produced cobs, the leaves shift direction to better access sunlight."
makodza hukomboka na kighaluka kuriko na mwanga wa dzua ndo hupa mimea nguvu ya kutengeza chakuria Kwa mchakato wa usanisinuru,"The leaves tend to bend towards the light, as it is the light that powers photosynthesis, which converts energy into food."
Ambrose chenye umahuambira ni jeri,"Ambrose, what you are telling us is true."
kwa akurima anji mashamba ni ghali na wanamala wapate mavuno manji kwa bidii waihumirayo,"However, according to many farmers, land is expensive, and they want to get the most yield for their effort."
"Nikilola kuhusu kuika kwa nafasi ,nielezea tototo kuno kuika kwa nafasi ni hivyo ","When I look at this spacing, while you have explained it well, what is the actual spacing here?"
Ra kwanza ni kuika futi tahu,"First of all, it is three feet."
lakini kuika futi tahu ni ni nyinji Ambrose,"But three feet is too much, Ambrose."
kumbukeni kala hunanyala mbeyu mwenga kila wina,"Remember, we are planting only one seed per hole."
nakubaliana na ue kala mbeyu mwenga kwa kila wina,I agree—one seed per hole.
"lakini mnona ii nafasi ,ii ni mwenga,ino ni mwenga na ingine mwenga","But you can see this spacing—this is one, this is one, this is one, and this is one."
ii ni nafasi bomu,This is a lot of space!
Ambrose nakuhimiza hutumie futi mbiri kuriko huhumire tahu .futi mbiri kwa fiti mwenga kwasababu hunanyala mbeyu mwenga mwenga,"Ambrose, I would suggest that instead of three feet, it should be two feet by one foot, since we are planting one seed."
"Kukukata kauli ,huhumira mbinu io io ura mungine kwa kuika nafasi ya futi mbiri","Just to cut you short, we also did the same demonstration on the other side with a spacing of two feet."
ihupa kuguguta kimwenga kwa mumea mumwenga,It gave us only one cob per plant.
sababu ya kuhumira nafasi bomu ni ili akurima waweze kuhumira mbeyu chachr na kupatata mavuno madzo,The essence of the larger spacing is to help the farmer save on seeds and maximize output.
Rero hahulola idadi ya mbeyu ya kunyala ila idadi ya mavuno undagopata,"Today, we are not concerned with how many seeds you plant, but rather with how much yield you get."
Aguzi wa mbeyu anadzinufaisha kwa kuamba akurima ahumire kilo kumi za mbeyu kila eka,The seed vendors are promoting a narrative that requires farmers to use 10 kilograms of seed per acre.
Hano hunamba kala akurima wahumire kilo sita za mbeyu kila eka ili upate mvuno ga hali ya dzulu,"Here, we are talking about using only six kilograms of seed per acre, which will give you a higher yield."
kwanza unaeza pata mavuno mara tahu zaidi na mutu ariehumira kilo kumi za mbeyu,"In fact, you can triple the yield compared to someone who used 10 kilograms of seed."
ukinyala na nafasi ya futi mbiri kwa futi mwenga undapata kiguguta kimwenga kila mumea,"When you plant at a spacing of two feet by one foot, you only get one cob per plant."
ila ukiricha nafasi ya kutosha undaweza kupata viguguta vihahu kila mumea na undahumira mbeyu chache,"However, when you leave adequate spacing, you can get up to three cobs per plant and spend fewer seeds."
uki bana mimea undapata kiguguta kimwenga kwa mumea,"If you squeeze the plants together, you only get one cob per plant."
ukiricha nafasi bomu undapata mavuno zaidi,"If you provide enough space, you can get more yield."
Alolezi mnaona kitu awambiracho,"Viewers, you see what he is trying to tell us."
ukibana hamwenga zizo ni futi tahu kwa futi mwenga,"Once you squeeze them, this is three feet by one foot."
Hunanyala mbeyu mwenga kila wina,We are planting only one seed per hole.
Ukinyala mbeyu mwenga kwa  kila wina undapata kitu here kiki,"When you plant one seed per hole, you'll get something like this."
unaona kala hunapata kiguguta kiki,"You see, we are having this cob."
hunapata kiguguta kiki na kiki,"We are having this cob, and we are having this cob."
were unareha kiguguta kingine cha hahu,It was bringing a third one.
huna kiguguta kiki na kiki,"We are having this cob, and we are having this one."
Uno wehupa kiguguta kimwenga labla kwa bahati mbaya,"This one gave us one, maybe accidentally."
unona huna kiguguta kiki na hosi hunaona,"You see, we are having this cob, and we are seeing this."
Inamaanisha kala sihobana undapata mavuno madzo,"So, that means when you don't squeeze, of course, you can get good yields."
Ambrose vyo hunavyoelekea kumarigiza bado hunanena kusu kuricha nafasi na uhendadzi kazi wa kwake,"Ambrose, as we wind up, we were still discussing the spacing and how it works."
kumbukeni kala matsere hukula na uvamizi wa adudu here kiwavijeshi,"Remember, maize is equally prone to attack by insect pests, especially the fall armyworm."
rero kwasababu hunyala konze wa msimu wa kunyala hunaona matokeo,"Today, because of planting outside the normal planting season, you can see the results."
msimu wa kunyala huwa ni msimu wa mvula,The normal planting season is during the rainy season.
gaga maeneo were ga kamae lakini hugatengeza ili kuwaonyesa zizi aina mbozo,This area has been very dry but has been instrumental in showcasing this amazing variety.
 Ukinyunyiza dawa ya madzi hurinda mimea kwa muda wa wiki nne,"When you spray once, it offers you group protection for a period of four weeks."
Nirivyogomba gaga matsere nikihesabu zo wiki gakula kwa muda uo,"As I have said, this maize, if I count the number of weeks, has grown up to this stage."
Ni here wiki kumi,It is around 10 weeks.
wiki kumi ni here miezi miri na wiki mbiri,"That is 10 weeks, which translates to two months and two weeks."
ta vyo bado huna muda zaidi,"So, we still have an extra period."
Namala mulole kwa uhehi,I want you to observe closely.
huricha nafasi ya futi tahu kwa futi mwenga na huna viguguta viri,"Where we have a spacing of three feet by one foot, we have two cobs."
hukifika hatu ambao hwenyala futi mwenga kwa mbiri hunapata kiguguta kimwenga,"Now, when we reach areas where we planted at one by two feet, we are getting one cob."
ihupa kiguguta kimwenga ,"It has given us one cob, sure."
ukibana mimea undapata kala unainjiza hasara ya viguguta viri,"So, you realize, however much you squeeze, it is at the expense of two extra cobs."
mwisho wa siku akurami huhenda gaga,"At the end of the day, this is the narrative most farmers have been going by."
akurima humala kuhumira kilo kumi na ii huwahenda wabane matsere hamwenga,"Farmers want to exploit 10 kilograms of seed, but you end up being tempted to oversqueeze your maize."
inasababisha  wapate mvuno kidogo,You then end up with a lower yield.
hunawahimiza akurima wanyale mbeyi mwenga kila wina kwa kuricha nafasi ya ya futi tahu kwa futi mwenga,We urge our farmers to adhere to planting one seed per hole at a spacing of three feet by one foot.
hukilola ya futi mwenga kwa mbiri undapata indahupa kuguguta kimwenga kila mumea,"Now, looking at the one-by-two-foot spacing, it religiously gives us one cob per plant."
inasababisha akurima  kupata magunia kumi na tsano ,This situation results in a farmer ending up with 15 bags.
ila futi tahu kwa mwenga kwa munda uouo hunapata magunia 35 ama 40 ,"However, with the three-by-one spacing, the same field can yield 35 to 40 bags."
utofauti unaombola kwa idadi ya viguguta vipatikanavyo,The difference lies in the number of cobs produced.
mkurima anyalae futi tahu kwa mwenga anapata mavino manji kwa kutobana matsere,A farmer planting with three-by-one spacing achieves better yields by not oversqueezing the maize.
ii ndo ushauri hunawawapa akurima wakati wa kunyala,This is the language and narrative we are trying to encourage among our growers.
kakuna haja ya kuhenda haraka au ku bana matsere,There is no need to rush or oversqueeze.
kala na umakini ndo mupate mavuno kamili kwa njira ifaayo,"Be careful, be attentive, and produce in the best way possible."
indawawezesha kupata mvuno ga hali ya dzulu kwabla ya kiguza sokoni,This ensures you optimize and achieve the highest expected yield before entering the market.
kwanoni akurima anafaa wanyale kwa kuhumira mbolea ya DK,"Now, why should farmers grow and look for DK maize varieties?"
karibuni hukala na changamoto za matsere ku zuliwa kwenye boda kwa sababu gana kemikali inayoifiwa sumu ya Kuvu,"Of recent, we've had challenges with maize being intercepted at the border for issues such as aflatoxin."
Faith Agro huwezesha akurima kupata bidhaa zirizo kazimala urihe pesa ya pasipoti,Faith Agro ensures that farmers get products that are passport-free.
"Matsere ga DK hunyalwa kenya ,Tanzania ,zambia ,congo na burundi","DK maize is grown in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Congo, and Burundi."
Ubora wa bidhaa kenya na Tanzania hukala na sheria kali kuriko kutu kunjine,"In Kenya and Tanzania, quality standards are stricter compared to other regions"
Nchi zizi zinamala mbeyu zirizo na rangi na kimo maalimu na urio na unga mudzo,"These countries want maize with a specific color, stature, and flour quality."
gosi gago pia hua wanamala gasigo na vidudu,"Above all, they prioritize fly extraction."
sababu ya kala akurima anamala Dk triple seven ni utengezaji wa unga,The reason why most farmers are looking for DK triple seven is the flour extraction.
Kilo 100 za matsere undapata kilo 70 za unga wa gredi mwenga,"With DK triple seven, 100 kilograms of maize will give you 70 kilograms of grade one flour."
Aina zinjine indapata here kilo 45 za unga wa gredi mwenga,Other varieties give you only 45 kilograms of grade one flour.
fikiria kupata hasara ya kilo 25 usagaho  unga,Imagine losing 25 kilograms of maize in flour extraction.
matsere ga Dk undapata  uwiano wa 70:30 na aina ingine undapata uwiano wa 55:45,"The flour-to-bran ratio for DK triple seven is 70:30, while for other varieties, it is 55:45."
aina zingine zindakupa wiswa munji kuriko unga labda ukale unyala kutengeza chakurya cha anyama,Other varieties give more bran and less flour unless you are planting for animal feed.
kala unanyala kwa ajili ya unga Dk triple seven ndo ifaayo,"If you are planting for millers, DK triple seven is the best option."
hukielekea mwisho aguzi wa unga vamanya umuhimu wa kunyala matsere ga Dk ,"As we summarize, millers have realized the benefits of DK maize."
"Akurima angine hunyala matsere ga kurisa anyama ,ao huricha matsere kumera kamili kabla ya kuvuna","Some farmers grow maize for animal feed, leaving the maize to grow fully before harvesting."
futi tahu kwa mwenga inaeza kwa kinyala matsere ga chakurya cha anyama,Can the three-by-one-foot spacing work for animal feed maize?
jeri ili kupata mavuno mangi kwa eka,"Yes, because the idea is to get more yields per acre."
"kwa akurima akunya matsere ga kurisa anyama Dk 8031,Dk 8033, Dk 1989 na Dk 777 zinapatikana","For farmers growing maize for silage or animal feed, DK varieties like DK 8031, DK 8033, DK 1989, and DK triple seven are available."
Faith Agro inakimu mahitaji ga akurima osi,Faith Agro offers a variety for every farmer's needs.
udzo mwenga wa matsere ga Dk ni kala inaweza kustahimili ukame,The number one quality of DK maize is its drought tolerance.
na hukula haraka sana,It also matures very quickly.
lola gano matsere gana here muda wa miezi mihahu hakeye,"Looking at this maize, it is barely three months old."
kala unanyala soko risha unaweza anza kupata pesa ndani ya miezi mihahu,"If you are planting for the fresh market, you can start earning money within three months."
unaeza nenda benki na meneja kukupa loni kwa sababu una dhamana kare,"You can go to the bank, and the manager will approve your loan because you already have collateral."
hunawahimiza akurima kulaki Faith agro inputs,We call upon farmers to embrace Faith Agro inputs.
