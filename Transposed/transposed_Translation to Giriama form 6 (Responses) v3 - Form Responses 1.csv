Io ni mbeyu mbidzo,That is good manure.
pia kuna mbolea ya kuku,We also have chicken manure.
mbolea ya kuku ni suluhisho ra muda,Chicken manure is a temporary solution for plants.
ina  Urea nyinji,It has a lot of urea.
mbali na urea kuna tatizo ringine ra mbolea ya kuku,"Apart from the urea, there is another downside to chicken manure."
mbolea ya kuku hudza na vidudu here huke wa kuku,Chicken manure usually comes with mites from the chicken.
Huke ao andavamia mumea wakwako ,The mites will immediately find comfort in your passion fruit plants.
undapata kala mimea ya kwako kaimera tototo,You will realize that your plants are not growing well.
kaimdamera kamare,They will not even grow at all.
Ao kuhe andakuka kwa kua wanapata chakurya,The mites will now thrive because they have food.
udziwahala kula kwa makazi yao na kuaika hatu kusha amabako andakula na kuvyalana,You have moved them from a temporary home to a new place where they can grow and multiply.
siwashauri kuhumira mbolea ya kuku kala kaidzatibiwa,That’s why I discourage using chicken manure unless it is sanitized.
kuna kampuni ambazo hutibu na kuguza mbolea ya kuku,There are companies that sanitize and process chicken manure.
mbolea ya kuku iriyotibiwa ni mbidzo,That processed chicken manure is good.
naelewa kala kuna Kampuni zinazotibu na kuguza mbolea ya kuku,I understand there are companies selling sanitized chicken manure.
anatibu na kuguza kwa viwanda vya kutengeza vyakura vya anyama,They process it and supply it to animal feed factories.
viwanda huihumira kutengeza  vyakura vya anyama,The factories make animal feed using it.
mbolea ya kuku iriyotibiwa ndo mbidzo,That’s why I think sanitized chicken manure is better.
nitoto kupata mbolea ya kuku iriyotibiwa,"In the market, it is good to find sanitized chicken manure."
ni mbidzo kwa shamba rako,It is better for your farm.
Inavutia,"Wow, interesting."
sasa huna mbolea ingine,Now we have the other manure.
hujaika mbolea yehu,"Yes, we have added our fertilizer."
pia i futi mbiri tsini,"It is also deep, two feet."
ehh hukala here ujuzi ,"Yes, it becomes like a skill, right?"
eeh futi mbiri,"Cubic two feet, yes."
Ndo upate mbolea nyinji,This is so that you can accommodate a good amount of manure.
ukishaudza mtsanga mizizi indapa nafasi mizizi imere ,"Once you return the soil, the roots will now be at ease to develop."
mtsanga haho si mufu here mwanzo,The soil there is not as compact as before.
haho kazi indahendeka tototo,"Sure, so there you will have some good work."
kisha hundasonga mbere,Then we move forward.
sasa ni wakati wa kunyala,We now come to planting the plants.
mumea wa karakara unafaa kunyalwa kahikahi wa mlingoti,"For passion fruit, you should put it at the center of the hole."
si kanda ila kahikahi,"Not sideways, but at the center."
ika kahikahi ili usitatize  umbo ,Place it at the center of the hole so that you don’t alter the dimensions.
Ubomu wa wina pia umafaa kuzingatiwa,The measurements of the hole are important.
angine andapima mita  mbiri kwabiri,Someone may have measured two meters by two meters.
Lakini ukishanyala undapata ni here mita mwenga  kwa mbiri,"But once you have planted, you realize it’s one meter on one side and two meters on the other."
undapata kuna nafasi kahi kahi ya mimea,You realize that you have an interval between the plants.
sasa hunyala yo mimea,Now you have planted the plants.
mwagira madzi kwa mimea,Water the plants.
kula kundanya mvula ni toto,"It has rained, lucky for you."
sino huhumira mbimu ya bitton drippers,"For us here, we have used button drippers."
hudzika mfumo mudzo  ili hupate madzi  siku nzima,We have installed a good system so that we have water 24/7.
mala nyinji hua hunalolera,We usually monitor and check.
humatsimba mtsanga kumanya kwango cha madzi kuhimira mkono,We just touch the soil and feel the moisture content using our hands.
ukishamwaga madzi io ni tosha,"Once you have watered, you’re good to go."
Hatua ingine  ni usimamizi mudzo,The next step is trellising and general management.
inaamanisha ku kuikira mimea milingoti,Trellising is supporting the plants.
unaona huhumira kamba,You can see we have used some ropes.
kamba zizi kufunga kwenye mimea,"On these ropes, you don’t tie directly to the plants."
Hunahumira kitu kiricho ikwa hotsi,We use a thing that we put to the ground.
kisha hunaika mihi kulingana na zo kamba,Then we start aligning the plant to the rope.
zizi ndo waya  zimazuia yo mimea,"This is the wire now that connects to the rope, which supports the plants."
Sababu ya ii ni kala ukihumira kamba tahu inafika wakati,"The reason for this is because we realize that when we use these ropes to tie, it gets to a point that..."
mimea inabanana hatu hamwenga,The plants are now starting to shrink at that place.
ni here unaishongola kwa singo,It’s like you are choking the plant by its neck.
pia unazuia mwendo wa virutubishi,You are also blocking the movement of nutrients.
wo muhi ukifura hatu ni kala chakurya kakikira,"When the plant starts thickening, you realize it is being restricted at that point."
eeh naelewa ,"Yes, I understand."
io ndo sababu ya sisi kugaluza,That is one of the reasons we decided to change.
hukala hunawasihi kuhumura kamba zirizo na urahisi wa kola,"Usually, we prefer you use synthetic materials, or you can use organic ones."
here kamba za minazi,Organic options like coconut chips are nice.
kamba za minazi ni mbidzo ,Coconut chips are very organic and effective.
muhi ukishakula hunakata kamba za mnazi  ili zigwe hotsi zole,"Once the plant has grown to a certain level, like this one, and we cut it, the coconut chips will drop down and decompose."
ila za plastiki si rahisi kuzihumira karehi,"But for the plastic synthetic ones, they are harder to reuse."
baada ya kuhimika  si rahisi kuzihumira kaheri,"After they have served their purpose, you cannot easily reuse them."
ii ni kwa kua zinatsanika kwasababu ya hali ya mazingira,This is due to the condition they have been exposed to.
pia kahumala zisidhuru mimea,We also ensure they do not harm the plants.
kitu kingine ni ukatadzi wa tagaii,"Now, the other part is pruning."
ukatadzi wa vitagahi ni muhimu sana steji ii,Pruning is a very critical stage.
kwa sababu unakata kata muhi ,This is because you are introducing a cut to the plant.
Hario katwa huricha nafasi ya uambukizi wa makongo,That cut becomes an opening for vectors and diseases to enter.
wakati wa kukata vitagai hunashauri akurima komboza vichipuko vyosi,"When pruning, we encourage people to remove any other shoots that grow from the plant."
ii huhendeka mpka mumea ufikire kamba,This is done until the plant has reached the wire.
kombola hotsi hadi kwa waya kumamalikana Shina mwenga ,"From the ground to the wire, the plant should have a single main stem."
hano humira mashina mairi,"Here, we have used two main stems."
unaona mashina mairi  lakini lakina vitagai tsini ya waya,"You can see two stems, but there are no branches growing out of them below the wire."
atu angine shina mwenga,Some people prefer to use one main stem.
ikifika kwa wayairiche iriche itapakaze  vitagai viri au vihahu,"When it reaches the wire, they allow it to divide into two or more branches at that point."
Jeri nalola ,"Yes, I can also see."
mashina mairiganaweza kuvamiwa na adudu pande mwenga,The double stems can be attacked by a disease on one side.
Kata kwenye  shina kuu,"If this happens, you can cut from the main stem."
kwa sababu kundamera ringine,"Since it’s the main stem, you can get another piece from there."
vivi si lazima ugule  au umyale mumea mungine,"This way, you don’t need to buy a whole new plant to replace it."
kwa vivyo hunasisitiza uhumire mashina mairi,"So, you are encouraging the double stem method."
io nimbidzo kunyala karakara,The double stem style is good for passion fruit production.
usiruhisu  vichupuko kumera kwenye shina kuu,"Now, you must discourage any new shoots from the main stem."
ikifika kwa waya ruhusu imere,"Once it has reached the wire, you can start encouraging the shoots to come out."
kuna kitu nisahau kuwaambira,There is one thing I forgot to mention.
kila mumea wa karakara unamboza vitu vihahu,Every passion fruit plant produces three things:
"kichipuko,lua na tunda","A tender shoot, a flower, and a fruit."
kala si lua undapata chipuko,"If it’s not a flower, it will produce a shoot."
lua na tunda hudza wakati mwenga,"However, the flower and the fruit usually come at the same time."
Lola kuna chipuko na lua,"You can see here we have a shoot, and here we have a flower."
usiriche kukale na vichupuko,You will keep on discouraging the new shoots.
vikishakula kombola kwa shina kuu huihwa vitagaii,"Once you have left the main shoots, they are called laterals."
ii ni vitahaii,This is a lateral.
ukihesabu kombola tsini mita 1.5,"If you count from the base up to 1.5 meters,"
unafaa kupata vitagai 25 hadi 30,You should have anywhere between 25 to 30 laterals.
