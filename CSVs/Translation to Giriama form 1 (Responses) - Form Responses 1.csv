Timestamp,Score,My name is Dipa tokaterica the farm Chief here at the farm Chief College,I want to share with you the good varieties of seeds which type of seed you to use to get good harvests,That's what we are looking for this time around,We don't want to just engage into farming yet getting losses yet getting nothing from our sweat,I want you to know which good variety of seeds you a farmer should use,Show you who is planning to get into farming to get a profit,So this time around we are at our maize demonstration Gardens,I want to show you one of the best maize variety that you should use,And that is DK C dkc 1989 and triple seven DK triple seven,I'm with the number one distributor that is Faith Agro inputs Uganda limited,"Mr Ambrose the director is going to teach us how ,when and what to do to get good harvests",Welcome director Alvarez thank you very much,"Our dear farmers, we are at our demonstration trying to transfer the knowledge",From the technical side where we are and share that knowledge in order,what you are seeing here it's a very good variety of maize seed called dkc 1989 dkc 90 8 7 8 9 8 9 8 9.,what are the attributes of dkc 1989?,Our objective as Faith Agro inputs is that we need to be able to break the science,Or to simplify that science in a language that our farmer can be able to understand,So when you look at these varieties it's almost given between three four three four two three four cobs,Actually I'm not saying any plant that has only one cob but at least they are three or four,we've always told the Farmers that if you planted dkc 1989 you are able to harvest between 35 to 45 bags of maize,I beg your pardon in one acre you will get between 35 bags to 45 bags of grain?,So when you talk of grain we are looking at those 100 kilogram bag of moist moisture content 13.5 percent,now how do we how do we arrive at that?,"it is simple logic, you know in Uganda we have a very big challenge","Whereby most Farmers ,number one, they don't know the size of an acer",What is the size of an acer?,Ask a farmer and he will tell you 210. the football pitch,"the size of an acer our dear Farmers, you need to get 40 meters with it and length of 100 meters",you'll get a total area of 4000 square meters,that one is one acre,I beg your pardon to get an acre you get 40 meters with it and 40 meters length,You mean an acre is not a square a has never been a square,there are three parameters through which one can get an acre,Number one we have as I've already said is 40 meters by 100 meters,number two is a 50 meters by 80 meters still we get the same answer,third method 66 feet by 660 feet,I had someone saying that if you get 210 feet by 210 feet that an acre,"it is slightly less than an acre, it is slightly less than an acre",so the right the right way to determine the size of your acre by dear farmers is 40 meters,with meters a stride is one meter so you can make 40 strides,"how do we do the spacing I'll tell you that by 90 centimeters,or one by three feet",now when you are talking of one meter you find that there is a lot of decimals,"Once we have that square footage, it can fit very well into our planting instructions of one foot by three feet.","This means when we plant one foot by three feet, each acre will be able to give us 44 lines.",Each line should have 330 holes.,"Yes, each line should have 330 holes, spaced one foot apart.",How many lines are there in an acre?,There are 44 lines in an acre.,Each line has 330 holes.,"In total, we shall be expecting a plant population of 14,520 holes in an acre.","In each hole, we plant one seed.",Ambrose mentioned that people often plant two to three seeds in each hole.,What is the implication of planting two to three seeds per hole?,It makes seed companies richer.,"We believe in one analogy: one seed, one plant.",That is why we take our time to ensure we deliver seed with a germination percentage of 100%.,"When you are dealing with Faith Agro, be sure you are getting high-quality seeds.","Now, as I was saying, with 14,520 holes in an acre, my dear farmer, you will need six kilograms of DKC 1989 or six kilograms of DKC 777.",That quantity is sufficient for our grower.,An extra four kilograms can pay labor for at least four workers.,Labor for four workers would be sorted.,"Now, assuming you have five acres, you would save money equivalent to 20 kilograms of seeds.","With 20 kilograms, your planting expenses would be sorted out.",I hope you are listening very well.,I hope you are watching very well.,"I am with the director, Mr. Ambrose, from Faith Agro Inputs.","These are the people who distribute a variety of seeds, be it maize, cabbage, onions, or watermelon.",He is trying to explain how we can get profits.,Farmers often experience losses.,People are getting tired of farming because of constant losses.,He is explaining the procedures and rules we should follow when planting or when doing maize farming.,We are introducing a very good variety of maize: DKC 1989 and DKC 777.,"Ambrose is explaining that by planting one seed per hole, farmers can achieve better yields.",Those who plant two to three seeds in one hole end up with lower productivity.,"For those who planted two seeds in one hole, how many cobs can they get per plant?","With two seeds, you will end up with an average of two to four cobs per plant.","However, with one seed, you are better off.",Planting one seed guarantees better yields compared to planting two or three seeds.,Why are we discouraging planting two seeds per hole?,"In our farming system, we are trying to encourage farmers to save on the amount of seed they use.","By saving on seed inputs, farmers can reduce costs and focus on better yields.",The amount of rain for each brewery is important.,"Remember, in Uganda, we are practicing rain-fed agriculture.","With the rain-fed group, you are not guaranteed total utilization if you plant too many seeds.","Therefore, the best method, as demonstrated here, is planting one seed at a spacing of 30 by 90 centimeters or one by three feet.","Now, moving on to how we feed this group during planting.","There is a fertilizer called YaraMila Power, which is a type of NPK fertilizer.",It is specially formulated to provide the nutritional needs of young maize plants from seed to about eight weeks.,"The advantage of YaraMila Power, especially for farmers on the verge of giving up, is that it only needs to be applied once.","With YaraMila Power, you may not need to top-dress.",Let’s assume a farmer was able to buy this good variety of seeds,but doesn’t have the money to buy YaraMila Power or other fertilizers we are talking about.,What alternatives can this farmer use to achieve similar results?,"As I said earlier, at Faith Agro Inputs, we are finding ways to simplify and break down the science into simple terms that farmers can understand.","Initially, we used DAP, NPK, and urea—three different fertilizers.","Today, when you go to the market, remember each acre needs one bag of fertilizer, which is 50 kilograms on average.","Currently, a bag of fertilizer costs 200,000 UGX.","This means, for an acre, a farmer will incur almost 600,000 UGX on fertilizers alone.","We are now reducing that cost to not less than half by saying you only need 200,000 UGX.",This amount will take your maize through to harvesting.,"Now, how do we go about it?","When planting, apply one bottle cap (e.g., from a mineral water bottle, Rwenzori bottle, or plastic soda bottle) of fertilizer per hole.",You dig the hole first.,You pour the fertilizer into the hole.,You can dig the hole a day or even a week before planting.,Allow the hole to ferment and acclimatize with the surrounding conditions before planting.,"When you are planting, get two people—one with the fertilizer and another with the seeds.",The person with the fertilizer is responsible for pouring fertilizer into each hole.,"The person with the seeds will check where fertilizer has been placed, cover it with a little soil, put one seed in the hole, and cover it again."
